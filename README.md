# all_my_CNN
 Repository to store most of my CNNs for Vision Computing jupyter notebooks

## Description

This project is just to summarize some of the CNNs I have developed to learn about Vision Computing, and I hope these exercises can help anyone else. I have developed them using Tensorflow and Pytorch. (Most of them only contain the final architecture I used, but all of these projects have a lot of trial and error, including their hyperparameter modifications.)

- `Cifar100s`: These notebooks contain different approaches and architectures for testing and comparison.
- `DogNet_v2`: a simple CNN for dogs detection
- `DeepLearning...`: to classify MNST dataset
- `Flowers_CNN`: a complex CNN that can classify a picture of flowers into 102 flower classes
- `TF_Sports_cassifier`: a complex CNN it is able to classify a picture into Â¿100? sports


I have included `requirements.txt` with all the libraries that you could need, not only for those projects, also for EDA or Data Analysis, or even LLMs
